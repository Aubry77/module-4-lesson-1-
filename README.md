Python Modules and Data Handling Assignments
Overview
This project consists of two tasks that demonstrate the use of Python modules, both built-in and custom, and the application of data handling techniques using Python's data structures and error handling.

Task 1: Your Mood Today
Description
Create a Python program using a custom module that asks the user how they are feeling today and responds with a custom message based on the mood entered.

Files
mood_responses.py: Contains the mood_response function that returns a custom message based on the user's mood.

main.py: The main script that interacts with the user and calls the mood_response function.

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory.

Run the main.py script:Customization
Add more moods and responses in mood_responses.py.

Personalize the greeting and responses.

Implement additional features like time-based greetings or a graphical user interface (GUI).

Task 2: Custom Module with Aliases
Description
Create a custom module named text_utils.py with functions for string manipulation (e.g., reversing a string, capitalizing). In your main script, import this module using an alias and utilize its functions.

Files
text_utils.py: Contains functions for string manipulation.

main.py: The main script that imports text_utils using an alias and utilizes its functions.

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory.

Run the main.py script:Customization
Add more string manipulation functions to text_utils.py.

Use the functions in main.py to manipulate strings as needed.

Requirements
Python 3.x
